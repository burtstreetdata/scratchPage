<H2>Introduction</H2> 
<P id='mostppl'>Most people have not stopped to wonder about the
topic of the aromatic exploration of the world. While we celebrate
  <img src="./images/fireshoe.jpg">that guy who climbed up Mt. Everest, or that other guy who walked on
the moon, who remembers the martyrs of protonostroligy, who wondered
  what a wasp nest smelled like, or a lion's tonsil?

  <P>People have other things to do than wonder about things like that.  If your job is to get grease out of little containers and stick it on clothes handing in a department store so people will return them, you don't wonder about the first person who sniffed his own shoe.  Indeed, the history of shoes is even more interesting and more accessible than the history of smelling unfamiliar things (HOSUT).  Did you know that there were no shoe laces before there  were shoes?  The impracticality of shoes that won't stay on your feet led to their not being discovered  until shortly before the shoelace.
